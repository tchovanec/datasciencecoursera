##Data for the Project

##About the Data set :

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain
        
For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Transformation Details

Activities that are being undertaken:

1. Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How run_analysis.R executes the above transformations

### Libraries Used
The libraries used in the R Script are `data.table` and `dplyr` and the library is loaded at the beginning of the script

### Extract measurement for Means and Standard Deviation
The use of the `grep` command is used to filter columns that contain Mean or Std.  The `extractedData` variable is defined that consists of `CompleteData` and subset using the variable `filteredColsâ€™

### Assigning Descriptive Names
Through the use of the `gsub` command to replace assigned names with more descriptive and friendly names to make the data set easy to use and in preparation for exporting as a tidy data set.

### Export data to new Data Set

A variable is created called `tidyData` as a data set with average for each activity and subject. Then the entries are ordered and then written out as data file Tidy.txt that contains the processed data.
